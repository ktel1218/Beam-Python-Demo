# Apache Beam - Python

# Apache Beam
__from [beam.apache.org](https://beam.apache.org/)__

What is it?
: An advanced unified programming model

What do I use it for?
: To implement batch and streaming data processing jobs that run on any execution engine.

# Some background

# Supercompute vs Clustered Compute

Send data to one big giant expensive computer
or
Break up data into pieces and send to lots of computers

# So, you want to run on a cluster?

### Step 1: Pick a framework:

* Apex
* Dataflow
* Samza
* Nemo
* Jet
* Hadoop
* Spark
* Flink
* Storm
* Sqoop
* ...


# Considerations

* in-memory?
* on disk?
* streaming?
* batching?
* microbatching?
* querying?
* machine learning?
* guarantees?
* Works 
* ...


Or dont think about it too hard and use Beam
